            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Ever wanted a way to easily share your project files with your team? Well, there is a solution to that problem and it’s called versioning control. Versioning control stores your files in a repository where they can be viewed, edited, and then sent back to the repository. A well-known example of versioning control is Google Docs. If you’ve ever used Google Docs you will know that you can create a text file and invite others to view and edit the file. This is the basis of how versioning control works. However, since users can edit the files how they please, there must be some sort of system in place to monitor activity in the repository. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Often abbreviated as “VCS”, Versioning Control Systems are very important when it comes to file management. Since versioning control is a way for several users to look at files and make changes, there needed to be a system to monitor activity. This is the exact role of a VCS. VCS’s keep track a history of who made edits to the files, the time they were edited, and what exactly was edited. On top of VCS’s monitoring benefits, several other benefits include: allowing multiple users to work on the same files simultaneously, ensuring files cannot be overwritten, and the ability to backup files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">With software development becoming ever more popular by the day the need for a quick and efficient system is most desired. Git has been the solution for many developers since its development in 2005. Git is a popular VCS and its ease of use justifies its popularity rightfully so. When Git was still in development, there were five goals the developers aimed for: simple design, quickness, fully distributed, ability to handle larger projects, and support for non-linear development. It seems the developers certainly delivered on two of their goals since the layout is slick and navigation is incredibly fast. It’s easy to see why Git is a popular VCS and I look forward to working with it more. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Like most computer languages, Git has many commands which, when entered, will affect your project. Since we are using basic commands with the current lesson, I’ll outline those basic commands. The first step when using Git commands is to identify yourself. By using the “git config” command you can enter your name and email to let Git know who you are. The next step is to create a repository for your files. You do this by entering the “git init” command. After your repository has been created, you add files using the “git add .” command. Finally, using “git commit” the files you’ve added with Git are committed and ready to be pushed to the repository using the “git push” command. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Linux</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Since Git was developed by people who worked on some of Linux’s features, Linux seemed like another interesting key concept. Linux is an operating system just like Windows or Mac’s OS. However, what separates Linux apart from these other operating systems is the fact that it is open source. This means that the original code from which Linux was made is available to anyone and can be modified. Interestingly enough, though many people have probably not even heard of Linux, it’s much more popular than they may realize. Linux is used in Android phones, navigation systems, and even several car models!</p>
